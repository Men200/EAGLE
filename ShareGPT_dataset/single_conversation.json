The form includes fields for an email address and phone number, with appropriate labels and input types specified. The submit button uses the Bootstrap `btn-primary` class to style it as a primary action button.\nIt's also important to note that it's a good practice to add server-side validation and sanitization to the input fields and also form action should be handled by backend server."
